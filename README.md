Hi! I'm shadowFunction, here on GitHub I'm sharing components of my Personal Knowledge Management (PKM).

- **Daily - Template.md**
 - The daily template is based on a combination of sources and modified over time to fit with what I have found to work on a daily basis. It is sequenced to flow with how the day develops overall.

- **PDF Redactor CSS Snippet**
 - The CSS snippet for PDF Redactor excludes specific information from PDF exports on the fly. This method is convenient for generating documents or sharing information while preserving the base markdown.
